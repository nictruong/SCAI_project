# SCAI_project
Attempt at making a StarCraft: Brood War AI for the SSCAIT
Code written in Java using the BWAPI

No strategies yet, still exploring API
- Can build depots when needed
  - TODO: Build depots with a dynamic overhead to take into consideration multiple production buildings
- Can build barracks
  - Can train marines as long as minerals and supplies are available
  - BUG: supposed to build barracks every 10 workers built, but it's currently only building 2
- Marines
  - TODO: rally them to chokepoint for now
